# CS50 Lab and Problem Set Solutions

This is a repository containing my solutions to CS50 labs and psets
scattered across the years.

I don't really like the libcs50.a library, so sometimes I just use
the C standard library instead of what has been found in cs50.h


To compile all solutions
~~~sh
./bin/compile.sh
~~~

The CMake generated `build/` directory will contain all the compiled solutions

## Disclaimers

1. This repository does not contain all solutions, sometimes I'm too lazy to
implement them.

2. These solutions may not pass the official CS50 grading software, but the main
algorithms and stuff are there. 

3. If you are a CS50 student, do not plagiarize off these solutions.
